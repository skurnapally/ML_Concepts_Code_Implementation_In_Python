    "# What is Jump Search?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Jump Search is a searching algorithm for <b>sorted arrays</b>. The basic idea is to check fewer elements (than linear search) by jumping ahead by fixed steps or skipping some elements in place of searching all elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, suppose we have an array arr[] of size <b>n</b> and block (to be jumped) size <b>m</b>. Then we search at the indexes arr[0], arr[m], arr[2m]…..arr[km] and so on. Once we find the interval <b>(arr[km] < x < arr[(k+1)m])</b>, we perform a <b>linear search</b> operation from the index <b>km</b> to find the element <b>x</b>."

    "Lets consider a sorted array A[] of size n, with indexing ranging between 0 and n-1, and element x that needs to be searched in the array A[].\n",
    "\n",
    "For implementing this algorithm, a block of size m is also required, that can be skipped or jumped in every iteration. Thus, the algorithm works as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Iteration 1: if (x==A[0]), then success, else, if (x > A[0]), then jump to the next block.\n",
    "\n",
    "Iteration 2: if (x==A[m]), then success, else, if (x > A[m]), then jump to the next block.\n",
    "\n",
    "Iteration 3: if (x==A[2m]), then success, else, if (x > A[2m]), then jump to the next block.\n",
    "\n",
    "At any point in time, if (x < A[km]), then a linear search is performed from index A[(k-1)m] to A[km]"
