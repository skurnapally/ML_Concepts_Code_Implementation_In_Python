    "* Exponential search, also known as <b>doubling search or finger search</b>, is an algorithm created for searching elements in <b>huge sized arrays</b>. \n",
    "\n",
    "* It is a two-step process. First, the algorithm tries to find the range (L, R) in which the target element is present and then uses <b>binary search</b> inside this range to find the targetâ€™s exact location.\n",
    "\n",
    "* It is named exponential search because it finds the range holding element by searching for the first exponent k for which element at index <b>pow(2,k)</b> is greater than the target. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Although its name is exponential search, the time complexity of this algorithm is logarithmic. It is very useful when arrays are of infinite size and converges to a solution much faster than binary search."
