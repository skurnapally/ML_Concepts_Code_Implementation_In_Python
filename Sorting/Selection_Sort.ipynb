    "<b>selection sort</b> is an <b>in-place comparison</b> sorting algorithm. Selection sort is noted for its simplicity and has performance advantages over more complicated algorithms in certain situations, particularly where <b>auxiliary memory (Secondary Storage like HDD or SSD)</b> is limited.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm divides the input list into <b>two</b> parts: a sorted sublist of items which is built up from left to right at the front (left) of the list and a sublist of the remaining unsorted items that occupy the rest of the list. \n",
    "\n",
    "Initially, the sorted sublist is empty and the unsorted sublist is the entire input list. The algorithm proceeds by finding the smallest (or largest, depending on sorting order) element in the unsorted sublist, exchanging (swapping) it with the leftmost unsorted element (putting it in sorted order), and moving the sublist boundaries one element to the right."
